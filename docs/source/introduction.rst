Introduction
============

AWEbox is a Python toolbox for modelling and optimal control of multiple-kite systems for Airborne Wind Energy (AWE). It provides interfaces that aim to take away from the user the burden of

    * generating optimization-friendly system dynamics for different combinations of modeling options.
    * formulating optimal control problems for common multi-kite trajectory types.
    * solving the optimization problem reliably
    * postprocessing the solution and performing quality checks 

At the moment, the main focus of the toolbox are *rigid-wing* multiple-kite systems.
